Known issues:

1. demo_classify():
    scikit-learn realisation of KNN classifier does not support acceleration
    for 'correlation' distance. It causes slower behaviour (in comarison with
    'euclidean' distance).
    
2. demo_faceClustering :: mmc_nn(), constructW():
   Low perfomance; matlab code performs well what makes me conclude
   that several errors are in python version of these functions.
    
3. documentation:
    Current version of package has a very poor documentation.
